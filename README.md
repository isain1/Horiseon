# Code Refactor Starter Code

The purpose of this challenge was to refactor and make the previopus code more concise. I did exactly that by changing the div tage to semantic tags, anmd changing a lot of the classes to id's because most of them were only being used once. After that I also accomadated for those changes in the css file to make sure that the elements were still being styled correctly.
